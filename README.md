# Randomized-Tasklist

Many a times it happens that I have too many things to do but I can't decide on which to do. 
I waste all my time deciding and in the end I end up doing nothing.
So I created ths app in order to do the deciding part for me. I basically feed it a list of tasks
that I want to do and it randomly chooses one for me.

------------------------------------
#### Task list:
- [ ] Add some sort of priority to tasks
- [ ] develop a GUI
